### Cervitaur - ZSG S

> **Rarity:** ?  
> **Creature type:** Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid  
> **Size.** Cervitaurs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with their cervine
> bodies reaching about 3 feet. Your size is Medium.  
> **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 40ft.  
> **Ability Score Increase:** \+ 1 Dexterity

**Age.** Cervitaurs mature at about the same rate as humans, but often live well
past their third century.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan

**Skippety Hop.** As a bonus action, you can jump a number of feet equal to five
times your Proficiency Bonus, without provoking opportunity attacks. You can use
this trait only if your speed is greater than 0\. You can use it a number of
times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you
finish a short or long rest.

**Extreme Reflexes.** When you roll initiative and you donâ€™t have disadvantage
on your initiative, you can use your Skippety Hop trait without using a use of
it as part of rolling initiative.

**Cervine Build** You double the distance of your High Jump and Long Jump and
you don't need a running start. In addition, any climb that requires hands and
feet is especially difficult for you because of your cervine legs. When you make
such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the
normal 1 extra foot.
