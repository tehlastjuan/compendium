### Kobold - ZSG S\*\*

> **Rarity:** ?  
> **Creature type.** Your type is both Dragon and Humanoid.  
> **Size.** Kobolds are between 2 and 3 feet tall and weigh between 25 and 35
> pounds. Your size is Small.  
> **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  
> **Ability Score Increase:** \+ 1 Dexterity

**Age.** Kobolds reach adulthood at age 6 and can live up to 120 years, but
rarely do so.

**Darkvision.** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.

**Distraction.** As an action on your turn, you can distract a nearby foe. Until
the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against a
creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. Once you use this trait, you
can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Natural Trapper.** You are proficient in thieves tools, and whenever you make
an ability check to create traps (found on page 84 of Xanathar's Guide to
Everything), you can add double your Proficiency Bonus to the check, rather than
your normal Proficiency Bonus.

**Regroup.** You may use a bonus action to move up to half your speed without
provoking attacks of opportunity towards an allied creature you can see.
