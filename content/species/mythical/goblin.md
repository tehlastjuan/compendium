### Goblin - ZSG S\*\*

> **Rarity:** ?  
> **Creature type.** Goblinoid?  
> **Size.** Goblins are the smallest of their brethren, standing between 3 and 4 feet tall and weighing between 40 and 80 pounds. Your size is Small.  
> **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.  
> **Ability Score Increase:** \+ 1 Dexterity

**Age.** Goblins reach adulthood around age 8\. They age noticeably faster than humans, and though few goblins live to old age, the most cautious rarely live longer than 60 years.

**Darkvision.** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

**Dirty Tricks.** Whenever a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw imposed by you to avoid damage, they take one additional dice of damage. The extra damage dice is of any size the effect uses and the damage is the same type as that dice would inflict.

**Arcane Servant.** You learn the mending cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Tinker’s Knowledge.** You gain proficiency with Tinkers Tools.

**Tinker’s Bomb.** Once you reach 3rd level you may create a bomb that becomes inert after 24 hours as a part of a long rest.

When you take the attack action, you may replace one of your attacks in order to throw this bomb at a point you can see up to 60 feet away. All creatures within a 5ft radius of the bomb must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 \+ your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (you choice) \+ your Proficiency Bonus) or take 2d6 thunder damage, or half as much on a successful save. The area within the radius is also covered in smoke, causing it to become heavily obscured until the start of your next turn.

The damage increases by 2d6 and radius increases by 5 ft when you reach character levels 5 (4d6, 10 foot radius), 11 (6d6, 15 foot radius), and 17 (8d6, 20 foot radius).

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblish.
