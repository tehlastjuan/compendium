Help action with this trait:

Encourage :

> Until the start of your next turn, the first time the creature you help heals
> another creature, they add an additional 1d8 to the healing on that feature.

Spite :

> Until the start of your next turn, the first time the creature you help hits a
> target with an attack roll, that target takes an additional 1d8 damage from
> that attack.
