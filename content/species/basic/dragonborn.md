Your Lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the
draconic Ancestors table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage
Resistance traits as well as your appearance.

#### Breath Weapon

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your
attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone or a
30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in
the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution
modifier and Proficiency Bonus).

On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your
Draconic ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
damage. This increases by 1d10 when you reach character levels 5 (2d10),
11(3d10), and 17 (4d10).

You can use this Breath weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency
Bonus, and you regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Damage Resistance

You have Resistance to the damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry

#### Darkvision

You have 60 feet range Darkvision.

#### Draconic Flight

When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic magic to give
yourself flight.

As a Bonus Action, you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10
minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the
Incapacitated condition. During that time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your
speed.

Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon.

Once you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
