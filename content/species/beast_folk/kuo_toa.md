**Slippery Skin.** You have advantage on D20 tests made to avoid or escape a grapple.  

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Aquan, Common and Deep Speech.  

**Otherworldly Perception.** You learn the _See Invisibility_ spell. You may cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for these spells.  

**God Making.** Due to the kuo-toas’ innate magical devotion, you can temporarily make an idol. As a _Magic Action_, you can choose a Tiny object that you can see within 30 feet of you. The object becomes a creature with the statistics of a kuo-toa idol for 1 hour or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, after which the object returns to normal. The idol is friendly to you and your companions, and obeys your verbal commands.  

After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long rest.
