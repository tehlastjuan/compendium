### Tortle - ZSG S

> **Rarity:** ?  
> **Creature type.** Your type is both Beast and Humanoid.  
> **Size.** Tortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 450 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third of their weight. Your size is Medium.  
> **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  
> **Ability Score Increase:** \+ 1 Constitution

**Age.** Young tortles crawl for a few weeks after birth before learning to walk on two legs. They reach adulthood by the age of 25 and live an average of 400 years.

**Claws.** Your claws are the “_claws_” natural weapon.

**Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren't natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air.

**Natural Armor.** Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.

**Shell Defense.** You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a \+4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Aquan.
