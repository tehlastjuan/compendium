### Kabu - ZSG S

> **Rarity:** ?  
> **Creature type:** Your type is both Beast and Humanoid  
> **Size.** Kabu are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Small.  
> **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.  
> **Ability Score Option:** \+ 1 Intelligence or \+ 1 to a stat determined by your ancestry

**Age.** Kabu mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to have undergone the choosing by around age 15\. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

**Low Light Vision.** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light.

**Multi-limbed.** You have four arms. You can draw or stow one additional weapon or object per turn.

**Natural Armour.** Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armour. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 16 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armour, but if you are using a shield, you apply the shield's bonus as normal.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Kabuseph. Kabuseph is an odd tongue, the language itself consists of a variety of clicks, hums and whistles making it nigh impossible for a non Kabu to become fluent. Kabuseph's text reads in an outward spiral, and its characters are small patterned hexagons.
